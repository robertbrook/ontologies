# Key steps to show on a CRAG treaty procedure 'gateway' page

# JW says

* Treaty laid under CRAG (= all items past and present)

* Treaties with Objection period A still running

* Report by a House of Lords Committee (covers both SLSC and EU Select reports – and any future alternatives)(Does any Commons Committee report?)

* Motion laid in either House

* Objection period B open

* Scrutiny period expired

# JD adds

My view for the Treaties gateway page is to keep it simple:

* Current Treaties (active objection period, whether A or B, open) – not driven by steps but similarly with SIs a query that looks for anything that has not concluded and has not been withdrawn

* All treaties past and present

* Treaties with a motion to not ratify tabled

* Treaties with a debate scheduled (whether substantive or neutral motion)

I agree there probably should be a link to those reported on by Committees but there should be some consideration of what – with SIs we have only those drawn to the special attention of the House by JCSI and SLSC, or upgraded by ESIC or SLSC – so I presume the best approach here again is treaties where a committee has recommended for a motion to not ratify?
