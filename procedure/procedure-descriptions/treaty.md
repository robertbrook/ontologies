# Treaty

A treaty may be ratified if the Commons does not resolve against ratification within 21 sitting days. A Minister may extend this period. If the Commons resolves against ratification, a Minister may make a statement in disagreement, following which the Commons may consider for a further 21 sitting days. Even if the Lords resolves against ratification, a Minister may make a statement that the treaty be ratified. A Minister may determine a treaty be ratified without it being laid before Parliament.
