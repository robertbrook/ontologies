# Made negative 

Instruments subject to the made negative procedure do not require approval in Parliament before becoming law. These instruments may come into force on any date after being laid. Instruments concerning taxation are not laid in the Lords. Either House may pass a motion within the objection period which annuls the instrument and stops it having effect.
