This step means that the approval period for the instrument has started.
The approval period is the time available for both Houses to approve an instrument subject to the made affirmative procedure. It usually begins when the instrument is made (signed into law). The number of days for the approval period and how to calculate it is defined in the parent Act. It is often 28 or 40 days.
