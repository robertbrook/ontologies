# Wikidata, Parliament and beyond

As the name might suggest [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) is a Wikipedia for structured data - a community generated and maintained source of information on everything from [television programmes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q607514) to [Members of Parliament](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q264766). It provides a backbone for the information in Wikipedia. It also provides the underpinnings of [Google's Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph). So if people are looking for information on politicians, there's a very good chance it comes from Wikidata and not directly from Parliament.

Over the past couple of years [Andrew Gray](https://twitter.com/generalising) has been working with [The History of Parliament Trust](https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/) to backfill information on Members, their parties and constituencies. Work continues to incorporate more data from sources such as [Rush](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/).

If you have an interest in what Wikidata is, how you might contribute or how you might use it to help with your research, please come along to G-01 at 2:30pm on Friday, 7th June. If you have questions or would like to attend please contact [Anya Somerville](somervillea@parliament.uk).

Thanks to Liz Marley for her consummate administration skills.
